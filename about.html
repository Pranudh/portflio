                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born in Rangampeta and completed my schooling at Sri Chaitanya School in Rajahmundry, where I achieved an impressive GPA of 10 in my SSC exams. Following this, I attended Sasi Junior College in Rajahmundry, where I excelled with a 97% in my Intermediate studies.

                    Currently, I am pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at Pragati Engineering College, Surampalem, maintaining a CGPA of 8.5. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong proficiency in Python programming, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                    
                    My enthusiasm for learning new things and exploring emerging technologies drives me to continually enhance my skill set. My ultimate goal is to become a proficient software developer, where I can apply my knowledge and passion to solve real-world problems and contribute to impactful projects.

                    I am eager to connect with professionals and peers who share my interests and can provide opportunities for growth and collaboration in the tech industry.
